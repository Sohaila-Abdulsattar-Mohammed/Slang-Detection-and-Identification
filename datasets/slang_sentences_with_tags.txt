We’ll be right back, DTTD!	1

My DW planned a surprise for my birthday.	1
She’s listed as a DWF in the profile.	1
He’s a DWM looking for a new start.	1
I had to check the DXNRY to figure out what that word meant.	1
You keep saying that, but DYNWUTB?	1
You were looking for your keys, DYFI?	1
The way you explain things, DYFM!	1
DYJHIW you lose your keys right when you need them?	1
Before you invest, make sure to DYOR.	1

Watch out, E approaching from the left!	1
E1 needs to be ready by 5 PM.	1
Don’t worry about it, it’s E123!	1
After hearing the good news, I had an E2EG.	1
I’ll reply in a bit, I’m EAK right now.	1
It’s not a tech issue, just an EBKAC!	1
I accidentally hit ED and lost my work.	1
That took a lot of EF4T to complete.	1
He gave me an EG after pulling that prank.	1
I told him he’d fail, and he totally had to EI.	1
The blog post is still EIP, I’ll send it when it’s ready.	1
Can you ELI5 how blockchain works?	1
I’ll send you the details via EM.	1
What’s your EMA so I can send the files?	1

EMFBI, but I think you’re mistaken about that.	1
EMFBI, can I add something here?	1
I sent you an EMSG this morning.	1
That’s ENUF, let’s move on.	1
Please submit the report by EOD.	1
We’ve already decided, EOD.	1

I was so mad, I told him to ESAD.	1
What’s your ETA? The meeting starts soon.	1
ETA: I just found the missing files.	1
That was the best movie EVA!	1
The EVO of technology is fascinating.	1
He was EWG me about my new haircut.	1
I sent an embarrassing email last night, totally EWI.	1
Her outfit was so EXTRA, but I loved it!	1
She handled the news EYC, excited but not overwhelmed.	1
That task was EZ, no problem!	1
The instructions were super EZY to follow.	1
The gamer I met was an F.	1
Let’s meet F2F to discuss the details.	1
That new game is F2P, so everyone can try it.	1
I’ll F4F if you’re interested!	1
I’ve been working for hours and I’m FAAK right now.	1
You look absolutely FAB tonight!	1
I forgot my wallet at home, facepalm.	1
That video was FAF!	1
What’s up, FAM? Let’s hang out this weekend.	1
Check out the FAQ before you ask any questions.	1
I’m done with this nonsense, FAY!	1
Add me on FB!	1
She’s my FBB, we met through a group.	1
I’ll FBC you later about the event.	1
Here’s a pic from my trip last year, #FBF.	1
We’re FBFs, but we haven’t met in person.	1
Pizza and wings, time for some FBF!	1
He’s just an FBFR, we don’t talk much.	1
If you want to skip the movie, FBM.	1
We’re finally FBO—changed our relationship status!	1
We’re in this together, FBOW.	1
FC that I get the job!	1
I’ve got an FC today, can’t take any more meetings.	1
FC’INGO, just tell me the answer already!	1
FCOL, why is this taking so long?	1

Just finished my project early, feelsgoodman.	1
If they didn’t like my joke, FEITCTAJ.	1
Shoutout to my favorite accounts for #FF!	1
It’s an FFA in the chat, anything goes!	1
FFS, can we please get this done?	1
You can complain all you want, FICCL.	1
Just made the best joke, FIF!	1
How does this work? FIIK!	1
This meeting is going nowhere, FIIOOH.	1
My FIL is visiting this weekend.	1
You’ll always be FIMH, no matter what.	1
I’m finna grab some food, you want anything?	1
She posted it on her finsta, not her main account.	1
Been working all day, FISH.	1
The answer is easy, just FITB.	1
Spilled coffee all over my laptop, FML.	1
That joke had me FOMC!	1
I have such FOMO, everyone’s going to that concert except me.	1
He really made me mad, I just wanted to tell him FOAD.	1
I heard about the party from a FOAF.	1
That prank had me FOMCL!	1
That test was tough, FRT.	1
Thank you, FTBOMH, for everything you’ve done.	1
You said the movie was bad, but I FTFY—it’s great!	1
We missed the bus, FTL!	1
Got the last slice of pizza, FTW!	1
You messed up my plans, FU!	1
That project is completely FUBAR now.	1
This project is completely FUBB.	1
Let’s FUD and see who wins.	1
I’m exhausted, time to FUTAB.	1

They’re not dating, just FWB.	1
FWIW, I think your idea is great.	1
If you want to stay in tonight, FWM.	1
My phone’s battery died, FWP.	1
That new song is FYE!	1
This document is FYEO.	1
Here’s a funny meme, FYA!	1
FYI, the meeting is tomorrow at 3 PM.	1

G2TU, I passed the exam!	1
I’m G4C, want to join?	1
That idea is G9!	1
If you’re ready, GA with the presentation.	1
You’re completely wrong, GAC.	1
Before you criticize, GAFC!	1
All you do is play video games, GAL!	1
I got ganked while questing.	1
Hey, GAS? I need some help.	1
GAS, how’s everyone doing today?	1

That situation was so bizarre, I’m LOLWTF!	1
That was mildly funny, but I’m just LOTI.	1
I just rewatched LOTR last weekend.	1
That was pretty funny, I’m LQTM over here.	1
That stand-up comedian had me LSHMBH!	1
This movie is rated for LSV.	1
I just got a promotion, LTD!	1
Can’t wait for the party, LTLWDLS!	1
Wow, LTNS! How have you been?	1
My old laptop keeps crashing, it’s an LTOD!	1
I read your message and started LTS.	1
Thanks for always being there, LULT!	1
I joined the prank for the LULZ.	1
I LVM, call me back when you can.	1
That was so dry, I’m LWOS over here.	1
Goodnight, LY!	1
You’re the best, LYLAS!	1
You’re amazing, LYLC!	1
I miss you, LYSM!	1
I just installed the latest update from M$.	1
How’s it going, M8?	1
He’s always calling his mom for advice, such an MB.	1
I can’t talk about that right now, MBS.	1
Wishing you all a MC and a Happy New Year!	1
MDIAC, so I know a lot about law enforcement.	1
Whenever they talk about quantum physics, MEGO.	1
That movie was MEH, nothing special.	1
The food was MEH, not great but not terrible.	1
It’s been a long day, MEHH.	1
That performance was MEZ, I couldn’t look away.	1
I’m MFI for the new season of the show!	1
MFW I found out the concert was canceled.	1
Hope everything goes well, MGB.	1
I’ll check with MGMT before making a decision.	1
You did an amazing job, MHOTY!	1
This meme is so relatable, it’s MIRL.	1
We’ve been talking online for months, let’s MIRL soon.	1
I’m with MISS.3, we’re going to the park.	1
That’s your plan? MKAY, sounds good.	1
He was being so rude, so I gave him the MLM.	1
Hanging out with my MM this weekend.	1
You’re coming over later? MMK?	1
Sorry, MNC—I’ll be right back.	1
I just received an MNSG, can you help translate?	1
The MOD had to step in and calm things down.	1
I downloaded a new MOD for the game.	1
You didn’t mention—MORF?	1
He’s such a MOMBOY, always calling his mom for advice.	1
In MOO, that’s not the best approach.	1
Are you bringing a MOOS to the party?	1
Can’t talk about that right now, MOS.	1
We’ve got a MOSS joining our team.	1
I’m out of MP, need to recharge.	1
Spending the afternoon with MR.3 at the park.	1
I made an MRT of that tweet with my own comment.	1
MRW I found out the concert was canceled.	1
I’ll send you an MSG later with the details.	1
I’ll send the first draft now, MTF on updates.	1
Good luck on your test! MTFBWU!	1
It’s been so long since we hung out, MU!	1
I tried making a joke but it was MUAH.	1
Haven’t seen you in ages, MUSM!	1
Goodnight, MWAH!	1
That’s personal, MYO!	1
I’ll handle it myself, MYOB.	1
Don’t worry, everyone’s a n00b at first.	1
You really aced that presentation, N1!	1
What’s up with you? N2M over here.	1
What’s new? NADT.	1
This plant is rare, NALOPKT!	1
I was going to call, but NANA—it’s handled.	1
I fixed the problem, NBD.	1
You’re doing great for your first try, NBFAB!	1
I love your new place, NC!	1
You hit two home runs, ND!	1
Do you have NE idea what time the show starts?	1
Is NE1 coming to the game tonight?	1
They NERFed my favorite character in the game!	1
I’ll pass on dessert, NFM.	1
I tried it, but it’s NFM.	1
NGL, that was the best meal I’ve had in a while.	1
I’m addicted to playing NFS.	1
That car is NFS, sorry!	1
You got tickets to the concert? NFW!	1
That meme is NFW, don’t open it here!	1
Be careful with that link, it’s NFWS.	1
You played that perfectly, NH!	1
I’m home alone, NIFOC right now.	1
Oh, I misunderstood earlier, NIGI now.	1
They’re proposing a new building, but it’s a total NIMBY situation.	1
BRB, NIROK for a few minutes.	1
Please send the report NLT Friday.	1
What’s up? NM, just hanging out.	1
Wait, NM, I found the answer.	1
You played that card well, NM!	1
How’s it going? NMH, just relaxing.	1
What are you up to tonight? NMJC.	1
Hey! What’s going on? NMU?	1
I told NO1 about the surprise.	1
That player kept dying, total NOOB.	1
He’s got some serious NOWL about computers.	1
What’s going on with you? NOYB!	1
Thanks for your help! NP!	1
That NPC just gave me a quest.	1
She’s doing great as an NQT!	1
You got double sixes, NR!	1
I just wanted to update you—NRN.	1
You got 100 points, NS!	1
That bowling split was tough, but NS!	1
I’m not looking for anything serious, just NSA.	1
That video is NSFL, don’t watch it!	1
That image is NSFW, don’t open it at the office!	1
I think it’s ‘accommodate,’ NSISR.	1
You didn’t win, but NT!	1
What’s up? NTHING, just relaxing.	1
NTS: Remember to send the email tomorrow.	1
Forget what I said, NVM.	1
I’d NVR do that!	1
You won the lottery? NW!	1
This situation feels like there’s NWO.	1
I saved the last slice O4U!	1
We’re facing a tough O in the next round.	1
Sending you O, hope you feel better soon!	1
Mission complete, O.	1
I got a great deal through OA.	1
OATUS, did you see the game last night?	1
That was an amazing shot, OB!	1
You lost your keys again? OB!	1
OBV, I was going to say yes!	1
OFC I’ll be there tomorrow.	1
He’s the OG of street style.	1
The weekend went by so fast, OGIM.	1
OH at the coffee shop: ‘I can’t believe they canceled the meeting!’	1
OHHEMMGEE, that’s so cute!	1
I’ll call you back later, OI right now.	1
OIB, what did I miss?	1
OIC, that makes sense now.	1
You’re really mad? OJ!	1
Going to visit my OL this weekend.	1
I met someone through OLL!	1
I’m going fishing with my OM this weekend.	1
OM, I can’t believe that just happened!	1
After sitting all day, OMAA!	1
You want to change my weekend plans? OMDB!	1
OMFG, that’s incredible!	1
OMG, I can’t believe it!	1
OMG, you look amazing!	1
OMGYG2BK, that’s the best news ever!	1
You missed the shot? OMGYS!	1
OMS, that’s the truth!	1
Just finished up, OMW now.	1
I’ll be ONL tonight if you want to chat.	1
Finished for the day, OO!	1
That comment was totally OOC for him.	1
It’s late, I’m OOH!	1
OOMF just liked my tweet.	1
OOTD, I’ll finally visit Paris.	1
Posting my OOTD for Instagram.	1
I’m OOTO until Monday, so I’ll reply then.	1
Can’t talk right now, I’m OP.	1
You finished the project already? ORLY?	1
I’m updating my OS tonight.	1
This might be OT, but did you see the game last night?	1
It’s late, OTB for me.	1
That joke had me OTFL!	1
I’m OTL, back in an hour.	1
It’s expensive, but OTOH, it’s a great investment.	1
Can’t talk, I’m OTP right now.	1
They’re my favorite OTP from the show.	1
That party was so OTT, but fun!	1
OTTOMH, I’d say it’s about five miles.	1
Got to go, OTW now!	1
That match is OVA!	1
I can’t make it, you’re OYO this time.	1
I’m going to dinner with my P tonight.	1
It’s nice to have a P2P discussion about school events.	1
P2P sharing is common in online networks.	1
This game is P2P, so you need a subscription.	1
Can’t talk now, P911!	1
PAP of your new car!	1
We’re on PAT duty tonight.	1
Can’t discuss that right now, PAW.	1
I found your number in the PBOOK.	1
My PC is a wizard in the game.	1
If you’re free later, PCM.	1
They were showing too much PDA at the park.	1
Got the job! I’m PDH right now!	1
I’m unarmed, PDS!	1
I’ll be there PDQ!	1
Hanging out with my PEEPS this weekend.	1
Your new car is PFT!	1
Send me a PIC of your new puppy!	1
That joke had me PIP!	1
PIR, can’t talk about that right now.	1
Can you PISS in my coffee?	1
This project is such a PITA.	1
I caught a rare PKMN today!	1
I just got a new PL8 for my car.	1
That was a well-PLD match!	1
PLMK if you’re free tomorrow.	1
Can you send me the report, PLS?	1
This event is perfect for PLU!	1
PLZ send me the details ASAP.	1
PLZTLME what happened at the meeting!	1
I’ll PM you the details.	1
PMFI, but I think we need to revise this.	1
PMFJI, but I have a suggestion.	1
That story had me PMSL!	1
You’re having a tough day? POAHF!	1
If there’s no photo, POIDH!	1
POS, talk later.	1
I need to use a POT to heal.	1
Check out my POTD on Instagram!	1
From my POV, this makes the most sense.	1
I’ll be taking my POV on the road trip.	1
A lot of PPL showed up to the event.	1
The package is PPU.	1
Your baby is so PRESH!	1
I’ll PROBS be there by 7.	1
I’ll PROLLY skip the meeting.	1
I’m running a new PROGGY on my laptop.	1
Be careful, that site’s full of PRON.	1
Are you coming to the PRT tonight?	1
Help spread the word, PRT!	1
Can’t talk about it now, PRW.	1
Just a PSA: Don’t forget to hydrate!	1
Let’s change the topic, PSOS.	1
I’ve been playing on my PSP all day.	1
Looking for a group, PST.	1
I was so exhausted, I just PTFO last night.	1
Well, we won the game, PTIYPASI!	1
PTL, we made it home safely!	1
That sounds interesting, PTMM!	1
I’m using some PTO to take a vacation.	1
I’ll be taking some PTO next week.	1
We’re having a PTO meeting at the school.	1
I joined a PUG for the dungeon.	1
I prefer PVE content over PVP.	1
Let’s try some PVP battles tonight!	1
I totally PWNed that game last night!	1
I didn’t understand your point, PXT.	1
What’s that smell? PU!	1
I’ll be late, need to PUKS.	1
She’s such a PYT!	1
Got to go, PZ!	1
Let’s order some PZA for dinner.	1
I’ve been waiting in the Q for 30 minutes.	1
Hey, Q4U—what’s the plan for tonight?	1
We need to run a QC check on the product.	1
QFE: What’s everyone’s favorite movie?	1
That statement is ridiculous, QFI!	1
They said they’d never change their mind… QFI.	1
What they said was spot on, QFT.	1
Let’s grab a QIK coffee before the meeting.	1
Come on, QL! I’m being serious.	1
‘Be yourself; everyone else is already taken’—QOTD.	1
I lost my keys, Q_Q.	1
Hey, QQ: What time does the event start?	1
I sent the message, still waiting for a QSL.	1
I had a great QSO with him about technology.	1
Look at that dog, such a QT!	1
My niece is an absolute QTPI!	1
R you coming to the party tonight?	1
R8 my outfit from 1 to 10!	1
You’re awesome! RBAY!	1
We need to leave RFN!	1
RGR, I’ll meet you there.	1
I got the best seat—RHIP!	1
RIP, we’ll miss you.	1
I can’t play tonight, got RL stuff to do.	1
RLY? That’s amazing!	1
He’s late again, RME.	1
RMLB, I’m not going to change my mind.	1
You need more details? RMMM!	1
That joke had me ROFL!	1
That video was so funny, ROFLCOPTER!	1
I couldn’t stop laughing, ROFLMAO!	1
That meme had me ROTFL!	1
The prank was so good, ROTFLUTS!	1
I’ve been playing RS all weekend.	1
I’ll finish the report RSN.	1
I’ll be there at 5, RT.	1
Thanks for the RT!	1
After that drama, I’ve got a new RTBS.	1
You’re doing it wrong, RTFM!	1
You missed the point, RTFQ!	1
RTHX for sharing my post!	1
Before you ask, RTMS!	1
We need to focus on customer RTNTN.	1
The pay raise will be RTRCTV to last month.	1
She’s planning for RTRMT in a few years.	1
You’re still confused? RTSM!	1
You missed the point, RTWFQ!	1
RU coming to the party tonight?	1
Before we start the game, RUMOF?	1
I’ve been texting you, RUT?	1
You seem upset, RUOK?	1
I’ll see you soon, RX.	1
Got to get back to RW responsibilities.	1
I need to pick up my RX from the pharmacy.	1
Feeling down? RYB for inspiration.	1
I prefer RYO cigarettes.	1
The instructions are clear, RYS!	1
We’ve been chatting for a while, RYS?	1
S2R your address, and I’ll mail it.	1
S2S, but the event has been canceled.	1
If you sign up for that site, you’ll get S4L.	1
That story was SAL!	1
I didn’t mean to be late, SAT!	1
His comment was SAVAGE, but true.	1
I’ll SB when I get your message.	1
The project SB done by Friday.	1
You sent me a picture of your smile, SB!	1
That performance had me SBIA!	1
I didn’t mean to miss the call, SBT.	1
It’s getting hot out, SC!	1
Goodnight, SD!	1
Tucking you in, SDMB.	1
SENPAI noticed me!	1
We need to improve our SEO for better website traffic.	1
When I saw the surprise, I was SETE!	1
Just took a SELFIE at the beach!	1
SFAIK, the meeting is still on for tomorrow.	1
You’re tired? SH, I’m exhausted too.	1
That’s so funny, SH^!	1
I forgot my keys again, SHID!	1
I totally SHIP those two characters!	1
I had to make the joke, SICNR.	1
I’m late, SIG2R!	1
After that decision, SIHTH.	1
SIMYC, I was in a meeting.	1
One day, I’ll SIR with this idea!	1
That joke was so bad, I’m SIS.	1
I’m spending the weekend with my SIS.	1
It was great catching up, SIT!	1
I’m SITD about the details of the project.	1
She’s always advocating for causes, total SJW.	1
We’re going to SK8 at the park later.	1
I’ve been SK8NG since I was a kid.	1
He’s a total SK8R with all the tricks.	1
I used to have a crush on a SK8RBOI.	1
Let’s meet at 7 for dinner? SLAP!	1
You totally slayed that presentation!	1
I spend way too much time on SM.	1
The sky was SMAZED after the fireworks.	1
He’s SMEXI, isn’t he?	1
He forgot his homework again, SMH.	1
The logic in that statement has me SMHID.	1
The meeting turned into a SNAFU.	1
That SNERT really needs to learn some manners.	1
I’ve got so many SNRs to reply to on Snapchat.	1
I’m going out with my SO tonight.	1
That SOAB cut me off in traffic!	1
Don’t worry about being late, S’OK.	1
SOL, you’ll get used to it.	1
I’ve texted you three times today, SOMY?	1
Just wondering, SorG?	1
SOS, I’m lost in the city!	1
He was acting like a total SOS.	1
Can’t chat long, I’m SOT today.	1
SOTMG, I’ll talk to you later.	1
Can’t talk now, SOWM.	1
SPK your mind, I’m listening.	1
SRSLY, I can’t believe he said that.	1
Let’s meet SPST next week.	1
I SPTO her about the event.	1
He’s so SQ, always following the rules.	1
SRY I missed your call.	1
SS for being late!	1
Nothing new here, SSDD.	1
That movie was SSIF, I couldn’t stop laughing.	1
His argument was SSINF, I couldn’t even respond.	1
You better ST&D before you get into trouble!	1
I totally Stan for that band!	1
I couldn’t believe what he was saying, STFU!	1
I’m STR8, not interested.	1
If you don’t know, just STW.	1
SU, I can’t believe you said that!	1
Goodnight! SUITM.	1
Heading out now, SUL!	1
SUP? Haven’t heard from you in a while.	1
They’re talking again, but I’m SUTH.	1
That traffic SUX!	1
That’s not true, SUYF!	1
I got so much SWAG at the conference!	1
I don’t know the exact answer, but here’s my SWAG.	1
I sent you a letter, SWAK.	1
The letter had SWALK written on the envelope.	1
I didn’t have time to check the facts, so I made a SWAT.	1
That joke had me SWL!	1
SWMBO says I need to mow the lawn.	1
Got to run, SYL!	1
I’ll be over in a bit, SYS!	1
You don’t know what you’re talking about, SYY!	1
We’ll get through this, just T+!	1
You’re the best, T4BU!	1
Having a rough day? T:)T!	1
TA for all your help today!	1
Got to sign off, TAFN!	1
Let’s meet TAM for breakfast.	1
That character is such a TANK!	1
I totally TANKED that boss in the game.	1
Our team was TANKING the competition!	1
The project is TARFU right now.	1
Just wanted to say hi, TAU.	1
Hope you’re doing well, TAUMUALU.	1
He got TBAGGED after losing in the game.	1
TBBH, I didn’t like the movie.	1
The series finale was such a cliffhanger, TBC.	1
The meeting time is TBD.	1
TBH, I don’t really like sushi.	1
I’m busy now, TBL when you can.	1
Here’s a photo from high school, TBT!	1
Goodbye, TC!	1
I’ve got to TCB before the deadline.	1
Stay safe and TCOY.	1
I love playing TD games.	1
He sent me a flirty message saying TD2M.	1
She jokingly said TDTM during the chat.	1
Spill the TEA, I want to hear all the details!	1
That video was TFF!	1
That article was really helpful, TFS!	1

That meme was VFF!	1
This laptop is great VFM.	1
